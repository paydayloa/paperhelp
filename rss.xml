There are a considerable number of stylistic infelicities and a fair number of grammatical errors. Grade E Sample In addressing such sensitive political material, these examples of media reporting have had to tread a slippery path between the opposing philosophies and interests of their varied readerships, and what is politically and socially acceptable. Examiners comment The conclusion of the essay is entirely generic. Any reader of the final paragraph would be challenged to guess from which subject this writing has been taken. It could be history, politics, citizenship, economics.

The verdict A panel of examiners looked at samples from essays provided by internet companies answering an English A-level essay question on Nelson Mandelas death and the media. Firm Custom Essay Sample The narration of the death of Mandela was accompanied with numerous statins sic of his achievement and his requirement to all people.
